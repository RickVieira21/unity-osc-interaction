This repository contains two Unity projects developed for the Interaction in Virtual Environments course, focusing on human–computer interaction through mobile device orientation and real-time sensor data using the OSC protocol.

IAV TP3 - Mobile-Controlled Maze Game - A Unity-based game where the player controls a tilting maze using the orientation of a mobile device.

IAV PRJ - Mobile-Controlled Minecraft Environment - An extension of a Minecraft-inspired Unity environment, where the player’s camera and character rotation are controlled using mobile device orientation instead of mouse input.
